Everyone had a great time, and solving the puzzles gave the students a sense of achievement! 在活動中鼓勵大家團隊合作，認真投入的組別我會馬上在全班面前讚美他們，給予大家學習的機會;也會遇到有組別頻頻卡關，這時老師就要過去給予協助並鼓勵．小組與小組間也能互相幫忙，提醒學生用給提示的方式，不直接說答案．Throughout the activity, I encouraged teamwork. Praised groups that were engaged and working hard in front of the whole class, providing everyone with a learning opportunity. There were also some groups that encountered frequent challenges; at those times, I would go over to offer assistance and encouragement. Groups could also help each other, just reminding students to give hints rather than directly revealing the answers. 有遇到少部分學生直接向別組問答案的狀況，我當時是和學生說：老師會再問你們的解題過程，直接知道答案，就少了解謎的樂趣了，如果真的想不到，再來找老師給提示．There were a few students who asked other groups for answers. In those instances, I told them: \u0026ldquo;I will ask you about your problem-solving process. If you just know the answer right away, you miss out on the fun of solving the puzzle. If you really can\u0026rsquo;t think of anything, then come to me for a hint.\u0026rdquo; ","permalink":"https://ytwwty.github.io/blog/halloween/","tags":["Alpaca","Festival"],"title":"Halloween線上密室逃脫X小六英語"},{"categories":["Go Language"],"contents":"Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Emphasis Emphasis, aka italics, with asterisks or underscores.\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with asterisks or underscores.\nCombined emphasis with asterisks and underscores.\nStrikethrough uses two tildes.
